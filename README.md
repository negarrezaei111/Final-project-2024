Design and Development of a Vulnerability Scanning Tool for SQL Injection and XSS

Abstract

In today's digital world, the security of web-based systems has become one of the critical
issues for organizations and businesses. Vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and XSS can lead
to security breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive data. The VulneraXSQL project is
designed to provide a comprehensive solution for identifying and managing these vulnerabilities.
This tool utilizes advanced methods and modern algorithms to detect vulnerabilities in web-based
systems and provides detailed reports and actionable insights about security weaknesses.
VulneraXSQL includes the design and implementation of efficient APIs, the creation of a simple
and user-friendly interface using React, and the design of a database with SQLite. This tool helps
organizations and developers analyze and address the identified vulnerabilities to enhance the
security of their web systems and prevent potential attacks. Additionally, VulneraXSQL serves as
an educational tool to familiarize users with security vulnerabilities and the methods for addressing
them. The project also provides a foundation for adding other types of attacks in the future. Some
of the key challenges of the project include identifying malicious web systems, managing data
volume, and ensuring the accuracy of results. The ultimate goal of this project is to improve the
security level of web systems and facilitate the vulnerability detection process in an effective and
fast manner.
